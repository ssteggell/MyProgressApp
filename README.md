Welcome to MyProgressApp. 

This is an app to allow users to track progress photos specifically for fitness tracking. You can create multiple albums for multiple angles, such as side, front, back etc... When taking a new photo, you can choose to take a fresh new photo, or mimic a previous photo. To create a new photo, you go into the album, select the camera icon, then take a selfie. If you want to mimic a previous photo, you select a photo to mimic, click the camera icon, and the previous image will be overlayed. You use the slider to change the transparency of the previous photo so you can line up your best shot. Purpose of this is to easily track progress as the only thing changing in the photo is you. You can also share a photo with a friend or save to your iPhone Photo Library. If you need some motivation, there is a motivation tab that pulls certain keywords from Flickr to use as motivation.

Run app as is, there are no 3rd party frameworks in place. Just import and build. 


Enjoy
